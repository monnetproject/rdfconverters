The XEBR2XBRL ontology (current version: 1.0) can be seen as an additional
interface ontology which links concepts from the Belgium and Spanish XBRL
taxonomy (there are no explicit ontologies for both of them) with concepts
from the core XEBR ontology.
This is achieved by using informally-described properties from the SKOS
specification as well as owl:equivalentClass and owl:equivalentProperty
axiom constructors.

The XEBR2XBRL ontology comes as a set of N-triples which is generated by
program code Thierry Declerck has written by "aligning" the Belgium and
Spanish taxonomies with our own XEBR ontology.
Using the raptor/rapper utility, I've managed to create an independent
Protege project for better readability.
